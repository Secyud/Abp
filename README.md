# Secyud.Abp
A simple practice of Abp to replace BlazoriseUi with MasaBlazorUi.

> Attention:  
>> The project remove all blazorise library and use masa blazor to build a complete ui theming, include message box, layout..  
>> So theming is refactorred and replace Volo.Abp.BlazoriseUI with Secyud.Abp.MasaBlazorUi as dependency.  
>> If there's no need to remove blazorise, it's easier to add razor library directy.

>> The default application blazor module with blazorise should be refactorred if you want to use them.
>> It will cost some time.
